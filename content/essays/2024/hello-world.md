# Hello World!

So, I now have a new website. Let me fill you in on what happended in the time I was shifting my content over to this website, as well as why I decided to shift.

## Happenings

So not only did I shift websites, I also shifted houses! I moved from being relatively close to the city, to being further out, which is ideal for me. Its not too far out to the point where it takes a long time to commute to the city, but not too far close, such that I can hear the city noise (which is not very pleasent).

That's pretty much the major happening, but a few small things did happen as well.
