This section of the website houses a noticeable collection of my essays, some written all the way back in 2008.

The collection is in minor despair.

## Notice

Do note that essays are different from blog posts. Essays are written less commonly than a blog posts, and rather instead of covering rela-life things, cover experiences over a period of time.
