# Cepumins

Cepumins is a team of not-so-loosely assembled team of Open Source developers, who work on popular projects such as the SearchScrape search engine, the Staticfy SSG system, and the YML + extension.

## A simple backstory

The idea was proposed by myself, Skrillx13 when I was invited by some other developers whom I have worked with before on a discontinued project. They enjoyed how well the collaboration went, and even though the project was abandoned (it was a bad idea, doomed to fail), we still decided to work on a few things I had in mind.

Over time, we accumilated more people, eventually forming a group. Now the group originally had no name, and it was just named "Skrillx's group chat". But eventually I remembered a really nice sounding name. The name "cepumins" was actually inspired by (no this isn't a joke nor a promotion) my old Clash Royale group name.
