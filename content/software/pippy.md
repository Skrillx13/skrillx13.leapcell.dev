# pippy

pippy is yet another package manager for Python. It has standard features similarly to what you would expect from a package manager, such as being incredibly fast, extremely simple to use, and multi-problem solving.

pippy functions in a way that is similar to that of `pip`, but instead of re-working `pips` features, pippy expands on them. 

## Key Features

- **Easy to install.** Install pippy with one simple installation script, requiring minimal time and effort.
- **Works like pip.** Works like pip. Pippy dosn't redo concepts but rather expands on them.
- **Made to measure.** Pippy is easily scaleable, allowing you to manage a lot of packages, without needing to worry about dependency hell.
- **Open Source, GNU.** You are in good hands with our GNU V3.0 public license. Feel free to help build and contribute to Pippy!

## Get Started

To get started, simply run the installation scripts refered to in our [documentation](https://skrillx13.github.io/pippy/getting-started/installation/), and follow accordingly.

Then, to start a new project, simply run

``` console
pippy init
```

This command initiates a new Python Project, and creates a `pyproject.toml` file, a `Pippyfile`, and a `README.md` file.

Now replace the "p" in "pippy" with a "d"! :fire-emoji:
